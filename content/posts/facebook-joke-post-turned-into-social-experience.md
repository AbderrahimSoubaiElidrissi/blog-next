# What happened

Few days ago a friend posted a joke post on facebook the post is a job offer for an US company with wrong frameworks names and ages.

At this point everything is normal and if you know [Abdelkader](https://twitter.com/xxx) you will easily notice that is a MEME LORD. however strange thing that triggered me is he **got 10 applicants for this JOKE job offer**.

My first reaction to this is that all the applicants are probably juniors or students looking for internship, but even in those cases you should :

1. be patient: Read the offer **carefully**, perform a search on google/linkedIn about the tech-stack,company,potential co-workers, and reviews

1. be selective: Select **carefully** an internship/job position based on your preference and set a roadmap to your career to have a clear 2-3 years vision.

1. be skeptic: Always ask the good question Why? and What? even senior people are making mistakes so it's better to ask than assume.

# Culture!

Hiring an IT guy is a bit different compared to other fields of engineering in my humble point of view the most important thing is motivation to work because I believe skills and tooling are the easy part.

Motivation here stands for the hanger to learn and challenge your comfort zone in daily bisis. Having this quality will automaticlly develope the sense of skeptisim and critical thinking and you will become better and you will learn faster with a good understanding of what's going on around you.

And by consequance a job offer like our joke here will give you a HaHa reaction instead of aplaying . Even you don't know technologies names or ages (I perosonly I think that is not acceptable even for a junior) your first reaction is performing a simple google search to see what you will deal with it during the interview or your new day to day routine.

Having a good IT engineer qualities,reflexes,knowledge and logical interpertation of various situations is included in IT culture and you should as part of this industry get some.

# Imposter doesn't have imposter syndrome!

Imposter syndrome refers to internal feelings that you are not as competent for a job or a mission compared to other persons with same position/experience.

Having this feeling during your career servial times is totally normal and everyone faced this at least once. and I can consider this as the tax of a highly evolated industry and daily changing world. The good part of is this feeling make me a reality check and break my Ego.

Having only the culture (previous paragraph) of software engineer without having nessisaire skills is impostering.

Being an imposter is not only bad for your self-branding but also it's propage a negative ideas about your school,gender,nationality ..

# how hard to get your first job/internship today?

Nowdays getting a internship/job is easier then 4-5 years ago the culture of remote working and the increase of number of IT companies is giving a large shades of opportinuties to juniors to get a better options and without handing all the legacy ways and old jobs requirements like degrees for example.

So this favorable situation should give you confidence and we should be grateful that things are getting better.

Based on this be selective because quantity decrease the quality and you will find yourself in toxic workspace without evolution chance
